# Code of Conduct

## Our Promise

In OpenSovereign, we expect all participants to contribute to creating a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

- Mutual respect
- Constructive communication
- Inclusivity

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks
- Discriminatory comments
- Public or private harassment

## Digital Sovereignty & Good Faith

As a digital state, we hold higher standards than a typical open-source project. Participants are expected to:

- **Respect Digital Sovereignty:** Acknowledge that data ownership belongs to the individual.
- **Act in Good Faith:** Disputes regarding governance or code should be resolved through the proper arbitration channels, not via harassment or sabotage.

## Enforcement & Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at **<conduct@opensovereign.org>** (placeholder). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Consequences

1. **Correction:** A private conversation and clarification of violation.
2. **Warning:** A formal warning closer to the community.
3. **Temporary Ban:** A temporary ban from community channels or interaction with the repository.
4. **Permanent Ban:** Indefinite exclusion from the project and potential revocation of Reputation Scores in the governance model (subject to arbitration).
