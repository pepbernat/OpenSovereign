# Principles and Mandates

This document consolidates the fundamental principles, governance values, and operational mandates that define OpenSovereign. It serves as a unified reference, linking to the core [Constitution](../constitution/Constitution.md) and [Governance Model](../governance/Governance_Model.md).

## 1. Fundamental Principles

*Derived from the [Constitution](../constitution/Constitution.md)*

* **Voluntariness & Right of Exit:** Participation is strictly voluntary. Citizens have the absolute right to exit the jurisdiction at any time, prioritizing "exit" over "voice" as the ultimate check on power.
* **Non-Aggression:** The initiation of physical force or coercion is prohibited. Force is permitted only for defense and the enforcement of voluntarily agreed contracts.
* **Subsidiarity & Minimalism:** The state only acts when individual action or free market cooperation is insufficient.
* **Code & Law:** Smart contracts handle execution, but a human appeal layer exists (`Code != Law` in the absolute sense) to correct bugs, exploits, or unforeseen injustices.
* **Privacy & Self-Sovereign Identity:** Personal data belongs to the individual.
* **Transparency:** All public governance operations and treasury flows must be public and auditable, while maintaining individual privacy.

## 2. Governance Principles

*Derived from the [Governance Model](../governance/Governance_Model.md)*

* **Anti-Plutocracy:** Economic power (tokens) does not equal political power.
* **Sybil Resistance:** One human, one weighted voice.
* **Skin in the Game:** Decision-making power requires demonstrated long-term commitment.
* **Fair Participation:**
  * **Voting Power:** Calculated based on a formula combining **Identity**, **Reputation**, and **Time-Locked Stake**.
  * **Citizen Instruments:** Includes popular initiative mechanisms, anti-spam deposits, and citizen veto power as essential checks on centralized power.

## 3. Mandates and Responsibilities

The OpenSovereign digital state is mandated to provide the following services under specific conditions:

* **Identity Provider:** Provide mechanisms for self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) and a secure, immutable registry of rights and facts.
* **Justice System:** Guarantee efficient, transparent mechanisms for arbitration and dispute resolution.
* **Transparent Treasury:** Maintain a fully auditable public treasury with a minimal budget dedicated strictly to common infrastructure.
* **Public Service Markets:** Facilitate marketplaces for mutual insurance, aid, and reputational rating without monopolizing them.
* **Data Guardianship:** Safeguard citizen privacy and the integrity of their data against external or internal threats.
* **Interoperability:** Promote compatibility with other systems and respect local legislation where applicable.
