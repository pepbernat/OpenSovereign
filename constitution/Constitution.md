# OpenSovereign Constitution (v0)

This document establishes the foundational principles and core rules for the OpenSovereign digital jurisdiction.

## Preamble

We, the members of OpenSovereign, establish this constitution to create a digital infrastructure for governance based on consent, transparency, and non-aggression, aiming to evolve into a recognized sovereign entity that serves its citizens efficiently.

## Article 1: Voluntariness and Consent

1.1. Citizenship and participation in OpenSovereign are strictly voluntary.
1.2. **Right of Exit:** Any citizen may renounce their citizenship and exit the jurisdiction at any time without penalty, subject only to the settlement of outstanding contractual obligations.
1.3. No obligation or law shall be imposed on a citizen without their explicit consent (sign-in) or the consent of their chosen governance delegates.

## Article 2: Non-Aggression

2.1. The initiation of physical force or coercion against the person or property of others is prohibited.
2.2. The state's use of force is limited strictly to the defense of rights and the enforcement of voluntarily agreed contracts.

## Article 3: Subsidiarity & Minimalism

3.1. The definitions and functions of the state are limited to those which cannot be effectively provided by individual action or free market cooperation.
3.2. **State as API:** The primary function of the state is to provide neutral, automated protocols for identity, record-keeping, and dispute resolution.

## Article 4: Code and Law

4.1. **Smart Contracts:** Automated execution of contracts is the default enforcement mechanism.
4.2. **Human Appeal:** "Code is not Law" in the absolute sense. A mechanism for human arbitration and appeal exists to resolve bugs, exploits, or unforeseen injustices in automated code execution.

## Article 5: Privacy and Identity

5.1. Individuals have the right to self-sovereign identity (SSI).
5.2. Personal data is property of the individual and cannot be collected or shared without explicit consent.

## Article 6: Transparency

6.1. All public governance operations, treasury flows, and legislative changes must be publicly verifiable (open source / on-chain).
6.2. Privacy applies to individuals; transparency applies to the state.

## Article 7: Governance

7.1. Governance decisions are made through mechanisms that prevent plutocracy (e.g., identity-weighted voting, quadratic voting, or reputation-based systems), as defined in the Governance Model.
7.2. Changes to this Constitution require a supermajority consensus.
