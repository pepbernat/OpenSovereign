# OpenSovereign

> **OpenSovereign** — an open-source framework for building a blockchain-based digital sovereignty infrastructure.

## 🌐 What is OpenSovereign?

OpenSovereign is a set of specifications, modules, and tools to develop the foundations of a **sovereign, open, and collaborative digital governance infrastructure**, focusing on:

- Verifiable and self-sovereign digital identity
- Voluntary and transparent citizenship
- Modular and anti-plutocratic governance
- Digital arbitration and justice
- Efficient public service treasury

This project offers **specifications, protocols, and reference implementations** for communities, experimental governments, DAOs, and identity projects to build interoperable services with digital sovereignty principles.

> OpenSovereign is designed to be the basis of a future evolutionary "digital state", but **starting as an open and collaborative infrastructure**, not as a political entity with immediate sovereign recognition.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🪪 **Self-sovereign identity (SSI)** — mechanisms for decentralized digital identity
- 🗳️ **Voluntary citizenship model** with clear entry and exit mechanisms
- ⚖️ **Arbitration and dispute resolution** based on transparent rules
- 📜 **Modular digital constitution** — fundamental rules defined in Markdown/JSON
- 💼 **Open-ledger public treasury** — minimalist and efficient public services
- 📡 **APIs and interoperability patterns** for connecting with existing blockchain networks
